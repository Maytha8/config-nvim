# Maytha8's Neovim Configuration

My configuration, file organisation based on [ThePrimeagen's config](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua/).

If your config is in shambles, I recommend watching imitating this way of laying out config files, as it works very well.

Includes stylua config.

Enjoy :)
